\chapter{Hardware}
\epigraph{People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.}{---Alan Kay}
\LJversal{A}{s a hobby project,} the design of the hardware and software for the readerboard
project ``grew in the telling'' as new ideas sprang to mind. As of this writing, there are three
different models of hardware prototypes which were designed and created.

\section{Version 1}
The initial prototype (\acronym{PCB} 1.0.1) was a fairly large board, approximately 20\sfrac{5}{8}$\times$6\sfrac{5}{8}$''$
with an \acronym{LED} pitch of \sfrac{1}{3}$''$.

It requires an Arduino Mega 2560 or Arduino Due to drive it. A custom-made shield board attaches to
the Arduino, which provides connectors for power and ribbon cables to drive the display (one to control
the matrix, the other for the 8 status \acronym{LED}s which appear in a horizontal row along the bottom
right of the matrix).

%One of the problems with this board is the use of the obsolete \acronym{TPIC6B595} chip. Later boards
%replaced this with a newer version. While it's technically possible to use the newer \acronym{STPIC6D595} chips
%on the 1.0.1 board, doing so requires a non-standard placement of the newer chip on the older chip's pads, 
%bending pins up, soldering jumper wires, possibly cutting traces, and and due
%to a pinout incompatibility between the two chips, the firmware also needs to be altered. As such, we don't
%recommend going this route. It would be best to use the newer board with the chips it was designed for.

\section{Version 2}
This version was based on the 1.0 design, but shrunk to a board size of about 18\sfrac{3}{16}$\times$5\sfrac{3}{16}$''$
with an \acronym{LED} pitch of \sfrac{1}{4}$''$. It also replaced the obsolete \acronym{TPIC6B595} with the newer \acronym{STPIC6D595} chip.
Further, it relocated the ribbon cable which connects the Arduino controller to the \acronym{LED} matrix, moved the
eight status \acronym{LED}s to a vertical column to the right of the matrix, and switched to resistor arrays
for the matrix current limiting resistors, instead of the individual discrete resistors used on the 1.0.1 board.

\section{Version 2}
Version 2.1 was a significant change to the 2.0 board in terms of how it interfaces with the Arduino, although it had the same size and physical
layout as the 2.0 board.

This one eliminates the need for the ribbon cables and shield board. Instead, the Arduino controller mounts
directly to the back of the display board. This means that the lower portion of the left edge of the enclosure
has all of the external connections in one place, including power, \acronym{RS-485} in and out, and the 
\acronym{USB} connector(s) on the Arduino itself.

\section{Version 3}
Revision 3.2 of the hardware expands on the version 2.1 design by replacing the single-color \acronym{LED}s with
\acronym{RGB} \acronym{LED}s arranged into 24 logical rows---each of the eight physical rows is logically a row of red,
green, and blue \acronym{LED} elements.

Note that the discrete status \acronym{LED}s are mislabeled on the revision 3.2.2 \acronym{PCB}. L$_0$ should be the \acronym{LED}
on the bottom (canonically green) and L$_7$ is on top (white).

\subsection{Version 3.3 (current model)}
The current version of the hardware (3.3.0) corrects some minor issues with the 3.2.2 revision by adding a cutout to avoid colliding with the
connectors on the Arduino board and adjusting the mounting holes slightly. It also corrects the mislabeled L$_0$--L$_7$ \acronym{LED}s

It also adds a R51 for Arduino Due reset circuits, J3 to manually reset the Arduino, and J4, R52, R53, and U16 to support the addition of a external
\acronym{EEPROM} chip for microcontrollers (such as the Due) which don't have one onboard.

\section{Firmware Implications}
The boards before \acronym{PCB} revision 3.3.0 are not supported by the firmware as currently stored in the project repository. They were prototype ideas
which were never built, so this shouldn't be a problem. 

There are compile-time switches documented starting on p.~\pageref{config-fw} which adjust the firmware
image for different microcontrollers, default settings---or the only settings if your hardware does not
include an \acronym{EEPROM} memory---and possibly, in the future, different board revisions.

\section{Construction}
Once you have created a printed circuit board (\acronym{PCB}) from the fabrication files included with the
readerboard Git repository and obtained the parts as listed in Figure~\ref{fig:bom}, carefully solder the components
in place. 

{\bfseries Warning! Danger! Only perform the assembly operation if you are qualified to do so. Soldering electronic components
may be hazardous due to the high temperatures, sharp objects, electrical voltages, potentially toxic materials,
and other dangers. This requires skill and expertise as well as personal protection equipment to perform safely.}
Please also observe all precautions to avoid damaging the electronic components themselves from harm due to
heat or static electricity discharge.

\subsection{Suggested Order}
For best results, solder components in a way that allows best access to the solder points without some parts getting
in the way of connecting subsequent ones. For example:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Solder all the surface mount chips first: U0--U15 (and optionally, U16).
		\begin{itemize}
			\item U0, U12, U13: CD74HCT238PWR
			\item U1, U2, U14, U15: ULN2803CDWR (ULN2803A SOP-18 packages may be used if aligned to the top 18 pads, leaving the bottom two empty, if they have otherwise identical pinouts and characteristics)
			\item U3--U10: STPIC6D595MTR
			\item U11: THVD1439DR (Note that this chip is oriented 180$^{\circ}$ from the other chips on the board, with pin~1 to the lower right.)
			\item If needed for your microcontroller (Arduino Due, usually), solder U16: AT24C256 \acronym{EEPROM} chip.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Solder the discrete resistors: R0--R7, R24--R50 (and optionally, R52 and R53). See below first to ensure the correct values are used
		for R24--R31 based on your choice of corresponding \acronym{LED}s.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item R0--R7, R35--50: 1K
			\item R24, R29--R31: 300$\Omega$
			\item R25--R28: 360$\Omega$
			\item R32--R34: 10K
			\item If U16 is installed, solder in R52--R53: 10K
		\end{itemize}
	\item Solder the 0.1$\mu$F capacitors: C0--C9, C11--C12.
	\item Solder the resistor arrays: R8--R23.
	\item Solder the \acronym{RGB} \acronym{LED}s D0--D511. Ensure that the common cathode goes to pin~2 so that pins 1, 3, and 4
		are respectvely the red, green, and blue anodes.
	\item Solder the single-color \acronym{LED}s D512--D519 in the colors of your choice, being mindful of the polarity. The anode has a square pin on the \acronym{PCB}. Our recommendation:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item D512 (bottom): green (with R24=300$\Omega$)\footnote{Resistor values based on typical \acronym{LED} voltage and current ratings. Check to see what is appropriate for your components.}
			\item D513: yellow (with R25=360$\Omega$)
			\item D514: yellow (with R26=360$\Omega$)
			\item D515: red (with R27=360$\Omega$)
			\item D516: red (with R28=360$\Omega$)
			\item D517: blue (with R29=300$\Omega$)
			\item D518: blue (with R30=300$\Omega$)
			\item D519 (top): white (with R31=300$\Omega$)
		\end{itemize}
	\item \strong{If you are using an Arduino Due:} solder R51 (1K).
	\item \strong{If you are using an Arduino Mega 2560:} Solder the 10$\mu$F capacitor C10, being mindful of the correct polarity. \strong{Do not solder both R51 and C10. Only one or the other will be appropriate for a given microcontroller.}
	\item Solder the Arduino bus stacking pins (six sets---1$\times$10-pin, 5$\times$8-pin---all labeled collectively at J0).
		Ensure the pins extend down and out the back of the board.
	\item Solder the 2-pin headers J2 and J3, and the 3-pin header J4.
	\item Solder the terminal block J1.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Option: Using Single-Color LEDs}
If you don't need \acronym{RGB} \acronym{LED}s for your application, the same \acronym{PCB}
may be used with single-color 5mm \acronym{LED}s instead. Simply solder them onto the board so
that their cathode is on pin~2 and the anode is on pin~4 of the \acronym{LED} footprint. This
means the \acronym{LED}s will electrically all be connected to the blue circuit. 

Since they won't be used, omit parts U0, U2, U12, U14, C0, C11, Q0--Q15, R0--R7, and R35--R42.

Set the firmware value \z{HW\_MODEL} to \z{MODEL\_3xx\_MONOCHROME} and recompile the firmware. This
changes the behavior of the controller so that it understands it can only drive one color which
is attached to the blue color plane. Now, all colors (other than ``off'') will turn the \acronym{LED}s
on.

\chapter{Protocol Description}\label{chap:protocol}
{\setlength{\epigraphwidth}{.5\textwidth}
\epigraph{I don't stand on protocol. Just call me your Excellency.}{---Henry Kissinger}}
\LJversal{T}{he control protocol} used to display information on the readerboard sign is very simple.
Commands are expressed largely in plain \ascii\ characters and are executed immediately
as they are received.\footnote{Technically, they may even be executed \emph{while} they
are being received.}
%It is not necessarily required for a command to be fully received first,
%so it is possible that the sign will have started operating on part of the command (e.g.,
%moving the current cursor column position) even if the rest of the command could not be
%performed.

In addition to plain, printable 7-bit \ascii\ characters, a few control codes are
recognized as described below. String data may include any 8-bit value except as otherwise
indicated.

%\section{JSON}
%The organization of the rest of this chapter is oriented toward a description of the
%protocol used to control the hardware directly over a \acronym{USB} or \acronym{RS-485}
%connection. However, you can set up a central server which is connected to all the
%readerboard signs and busylight indicators in a small area (via \acronym{USB} or \acronym{RS-485}).
%This allows clients to send commands to the server over the network for control of the readerboards.
%
%The protocol between clients and servers uses messages which are simple \acronym{JSON} representations
%of the underlying hardware protocol, which is more convenient for network clients and servers to use.
%Since this mirrors the hardware protocol, those \acronym{JSON} objects will be listed below as well.
%
%As a general rule, these messages are each terminated with a newline, and may not contain newlines otherwise.
%
%Clients and servers \MUST\ accept \acronym{UTF-8} but \SHOULD\ emit 7-bit \acronym{ASCII} with standard \acronym{JSON} escape
%codes for codepoints greater than 127.
\section{Web Service API}
The organization of the rest of this chapter is oriented toward a description of the
protocol used to control the hardware directly over a \acronym{USB} or \acronym{RS-485}
connection. However, you can set up a central server which is connected to all the
readerboard signs and busylight indicators in a small area (via \acronym{USB} or \acronym{RS-485}).
This allows clients to send commands to the server over the network for control of the readerboards.

The protocol between clients and servers uses messages which are simple \acronym{HTTP} requests
posted to the server's listening port \acronym{URL}. If the server were configured to run
on \z{example.org} on port \z{43210}, then all client requests to that server would begin with

\begin{Coding}
	|http://example.org:43210/readerboard/v1/|\Var*{message}|?a=|\Var*{targets}
\end{Coding}

\subsection{Message Data Fields}
As a general rule, if a message expects a field that is not provided, a suitable ``zero'' value will be assumed
for that field. Any extra fields sent that were not expected are silently ignored.

Boolean fields may have values \z{true} or \z{false}; if they are presented without a value, they are considered to be
\z{true}, and if completely missing they are assumed to be \z{false}. Thus,

\begin{Coding}
	\dots|/readerboard/v1/|\Var*{message}|?a=|\Var*{targets}|&status=true|
\end{Coding}

\noindent is equivalent to

\begin{Coding}
	\dots|/readerboard/v1/|\Var*{message}|?a=|\Var*{targets}|&status|
\end{Coding}

\noindent and

\begin{Coding}
	\dots|/readerboard/v1/|\Var*{message}|?a=|\Var*{targets}|&status=false|
\end{Coding}

\noindent is equivalent to

\begin{Coding}
	\dots|/readerboard/v1/|\Var*{message}|?a=|\Var*{targets}
\end{Coding}

\subsection{Message Target Addresses}
Every message also has a field called ``\z{a}'' which is a comma-separated list of target readerboards to which the message
applies.

So, for example, the message containing \z{a=2} would cause the server to transmit the corresponding command to the readerboard with address 2 directly connected to it via \acronym{USB}, or
would transmit to the \acronym{RS-485} network the command starting with the hex byte \z{92}$_{16}$. (Why that byte value is sent will make sense after you read the protocol
description that follows.)

If multiple devices are targeted, e.g., with a message containing the field \z{a=2,5,37} with address 15 (i.e., \z{0F}$_{16}$) configured as the global address \Var{ad$_G$},
it will transmit to the \acronym{RS-485} network a command starting with the hex byte sequence \z{BF}$_{16}$ \z{03}$_{16}$ \z{02}$_{16}$ \z{05}$_{16}$ \z{25}$_{16}$.
\section{USB vs. RS-485}
The protocol used to send commands to the readerboard is different depending on
whether the host is sending directly to a single readerboard over a \acronym{USB}
cable, or to (possibly) multiple readerboards over an RS-485 bus network.

\subsection{USB}
A readerboard connected via \acronym{USB} accepts the commands just as documented
below, with the addition that each such command is terminated by a 
\z{\textasciicircum D} byte (hex value \z{04}$_{16}$).
\begin{center}
\begin{bytefield}[endianness=little,bitwidth=0.11111\textwidth]{9}
	\bitbox[]{1}{\scriptsize0}&
	\bitbox[]{1}{\scriptsize\dots}&
	\bitbox[]{1}{\scriptsize$n-1$}&
	\bitbox[]{1}{\scriptsize$n$}\\
	\bitbox{3}{\Var*{command}}&
	\bitbox{1}{\z{\textasciicircum D}}
\end{bytefield}
\end{center}

If there is an error parsing or executing a command, the readerboard will ignore
all subsequent input until a \z{\textasciicircum D} is received, whereupon it will
expect to see the start of another command. Thus, \z{\textasciicircum D} may not
appear in any transmitted data except to terminate commands.

Commands which contain arbitrary-size data fields, such as text strings or lists of
\acronym{LED}s to light in sequence, end such fields with a terminator byte. In most cases
this may be
either a dollar-sign (``\z{\$}'') character or the
escape control character (hex byte \z{1B}$_{16}$), indicated in the protocol diagrams below
simply as ``\z{\$}''. In cases where a dollar-sign could be part of the data, then
only an escape character may be used to terminate the field, in which case the protocol
description will show the terminator as ``\z{ESC}''.
\subsection{RS-485}
Commands sent over RS-485 are intended to target one or more of a set of
connected readerboards over a network which may also contain other Lumos-protocol-compatible
devices, so they adhere to a protocol that is also compatible with those devices.

Each command begins with one of the following binary headers, depending on the
set of target readerboard signs which should obey the command.

\subsubsection{Single Target or All Readerboards}
To send a command to a single sign, begin with a single byte encoded as:
\begin{center}
	\begin{bytefield}[endianness=big]{8}
		\bitheader{0-7} \\
		\bitbox{1}{\z{1}}&
		\bitbox[tbl]{1}{\z0}&
		\bitbox[tb]{1}{\z0}&
		\bitbox[tbr]{1}{\z1}&
		\bitbox{4}{\Var*{ad}}
	\end{bytefield}
\end{center}
where \Var*{ad} is the sign's address on the bus, which must be a value in the
range 0--15. This byte is followed by any command as described below. 
If the global address \Var{ad$_G$} is given as the \Var*{ad} value, then all readerboards
which have that set as their global address will obey the command.

\subsubsection{Multiple Targets}
Alternatively, a command may be targeted to multiple signs by starting the command
with a multi-byte code:
\begin{center}
	\begin{bytefield}[endianness=big]{8}
		\bitheader{0-7} \\
		\bitbox{1}{\z{1}}&
		\bitbox[tbl]{1}{\z0}&
		\bitbox[tb]{1}{\z1}&
		\bitbox[tbr]{1}{\z1}&
		\bitbox{4}{\Var*{ad$_G$}}\\
		\bitbox{1}{\z0}&
		\bitbox{1}{\z0}&
		\bitbox{6}{\Var*{n}}\\
		\bitbox{1}{\z0}&
		\bitbox{1}{\z0}&
		\bitbox{6}{\Var*{ad$_0$}}\\
		\bitbox[]{8}{$\vdots$\strut}\\
		\bitbox{1}{\z0}&
		\bitbox{1}{\z0}&
		\bitbox{6}{\Var*{ad$_{n-1}$}}
	\end{bytefield}
\end{center}
where \Var*{ad$_G$} is the ``global'' device address which signals readerboards
generally (see the \z= command below).
This will send to the \Var*{n} devices addressed as \Var*{ad$_0$} through \Var*{ad$_{n-1}$}.

Note that device addresses are constrained to the range 0--15 if they are to be addressed in
the command start byte. However, using the multiple target header, device addresses in the
range 0--63 may be used.

%\subsubsection{All Targets}
%If you wish to send a command to all attached readerboards, simply send the
%following byte ahead of the command:
%\begin{center}
%	\begin{bytefield}[endianness=big]{8}
%		\bitheader{0-7} \\
%		\bitbox{1}{\z{1}}&
%		\bitbox[tbl]{1}{\z1}&
%		\bitbox[tb]{1}{\z0}&
%		\bitbox[tbr]{1}{\z1}&
%		\bitbox{4}{\Var*{ad$_G$}}
%	\end{bytefield}
%\end{center}
%where \Var*{ad$_G$} is the ``global'' device address which signals readerboards
%generally (see the \z= command below).

\subsubsection{Response Headers}
For commands which send a response back to the computer, the RS-485 data stream begins with the header
\begin{center}
	\begin{bytefield}[endianness=big]{8}
		\bitheader{0-7} \\
		\bitbox{1}{\z1}&
		\bitbox[tbl]{1}{\z1}&
		\bitbox[tb]{1}{\z0}&
		\bitbox[tbr]{1}{\z1}&
		\bitbox{4}{\Var*{ad}}
	\end{bytefield}
\end{center}
where \Var*{ad} is the device address of the responding unit if \Var*{ad} $<$ 16. For devices with
higher-numbered addresses, the following extended format is used instead:
\begin{center}
	\begin{bytefield}[endianness=big]{8}
		\bitheader{0-7} \\
		\bitbox{1}{\z1}&
		\bitbox[tbl]{1}{\z1}&
		\bitbox[tb]{1}{\z1}&
		\bitbox[tbr]{1}{\z1}&
		\bitbox{4}{\Var*{ad}$_G$}\\
		\bitbox{1}{\z0}&
		\bitbox{7}{1}\\
		\bitbox{1}{\z0}&
		\bitbox{1}{\z0}&
		\bitbox{6}{\Var*{ad}}
	\end{bytefield}
\end{center}
\subsubsection{All Off}
As a special case, the single byte
\begin{center}
	\begin{bytefield}[endianness=big]{8}
		\bitheader{0-7} \\
		\bitbox{1}{\z{1}}&
		\bitbox[tbl]{1}{\z0}&
		\bitbox[tb]{1}{\z0}&
		\bitbox[tbr]{1}{\z0}&
		\bitbox{4}{\Var*{ad}}
	\end{bytefield}
\end{center}
will cause the readerboard addressed as \Var*{ad} to turn off all \led s.
If \Var*{ad} is the \Var{ad$_G$} address, then all readerboards will turn off
all \led s.

No other command bytes need to follow; this byte is sufficient to turn off
the sign(s).

%The corresponding \acronym{JSON} message is
%\begin{Coding}
%|{"m":"off","a":[|\Var*{ad}|]}|
%\end{Coding}
The corresponding \acronym{HTTP} message is
\begin{Coding}
	|/readerboard/v1/alloff?a=|\Var*{ad}
\end{Coding}

\subsubsection{Subsequent Command Bytes}
All subsequent bytes which follow the above binary headers \emph{must} have their
\acronym{MSB} cleared to \z0. 

To cover cases where a value sent as part of a command must have the \acronym{MSB}
set, we use the following escape codes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A hex byte \z{7E}$_{16}$ causes the next byte received to have its
		\acronym{MSB} set upon receipt.
	\item A hex byte \z{7F}$_{16}$ causes the next byte to be accepted without
		any further interpretation.
\end{itemize}
Thus, the byte \z{C4}$_{16}$ is sent as the two-byte sequence \z{7E~44},
while a literal \z{7E} is sent as \z{7F~7E} and a literal \z{7F} as \z{7F~7F}.

If there is an error parsing or executing a command, the readerboard will ignore
all subsequent input until a byte arrives with its \acronym{MSB} set to \z1,
whereupon it will expect to see the start of another command. 

A few illustrative examples are shown in Table~\ref{tbl:escapes}.
\begin{table}

%\section{Command Addressing}
%Commands may be received over the \acronym{USB} port (a point-to-point connection with a host computer)
%or the RS-485 port (as part of a network of devices all connected to a single host computer's port).
%Commands received over the \acronym{USB} port \mc{MAY} be prefixed by an address specifier as described
%below. Those received over the RS-485 network \mc{MUST} have such a prefix (unless 
%using Lumos-compatible mode as described below).
%
%The address specifier prefix has the form:
%\begin{center}
%\begin{bytefield}[endianness=little,bitwidth=0.11111\textwidth]{9}
%	\bitbox[]{1}{\scriptsize0}&
%	\bitbox[]{1}{\scriptsize1}&
%	\bitbox[]{1}{\scriptsize\dots}&
%	\bitbox[]{1}{\scriptsize$n$}&
%	\bitbox[]{1}{\scriptsize$n+1$}\\
%	\bitbox{1}{\z{/}} &
%	\bitbox[tbl]{1}{\Var*{ad$_0$}}&
%	\bitbox[tb]{1}{$\cdots$}&
%	\bitbox[tbr]{1}{\Var*{ad$_{n-1}$}}&
%	\bitbox{1}{\z{\$}}
%\end{bytefield}
%\end{center}
%
%The \Var*{ad} parameters give the address(es) of the sign(s) which should obey the following
%command. Each is a value from 0--63 encoded as shown in Table~\ref{tbl:int063}. If the list of
%addresses is empty,
%all signs should respond to the command. The address list
%terminator may be a dollar-sign or escape
%character (hex byte \z{1B}), indicated in the protocol description as \z{\$}.
%
%If sent over the \acronym{USB} port, the address prefix is allowed but ignored, and the readerboard
%acts as if all commands are addressed to it, since the commands are received over a private connection
%between the host and that readerboard.
%
%If sent over the RS-485 port, the following escape codes are recognized.
%To send a byte value greater than 127, it is necessary to send it as the two-byte sequence:
%\begin{center}
%	\begin{bytefield}[endianness=big]{8}
%		\bitheader{0-7} \\
%		\bitbox{1}{\z0}&
%		\bitbox[tbl]{1}{\z1}&
%		\bitbox[tb]{1}{\z1}&
%		\bitbox[tb]{1}{\z1}&
%		\bitbox[tb]{1}{\z1}&
%		\bitbox[tb]{1}{\z1}&
%		\bitbox[tb]{1}{\z1}&
%		\bitbox[tbr]{1}{\z0}\\
%		\bitbox{1}{\z0}&
%		\bitbox{7}{\Var*{x}}
%	\end{bytefield}
%\end{center}
%This accepts the byte \Var*{x}, with its \acronym{MSB} set to \z1.
%
%To send a literal value of \z{7E}$_{16}$ rather than having it start the above
%escape, simply start with the other escape sequence:
%\begin{center}
%	\begin{bytefield}[endianness=big]{8}
%		\bitheader{0-7} \\
%		\bitbox{1}{\z0}&
%		\bitbox[tbl]{1}{\z1}&
%		\bitbox[tb]{1}{\z1}&
%		\bitbox[tb]{1}{\z1}&
%		\bitbox[tb]{1}{\z1}&
%		\bitbox[tb]{1}{\z1}&
%		\bitbox[tb]{1}{\z1}&
%		\bitbox[tbr]{1}{\z1}\\
%		\bitbox{1}{\z0}&
%		\bitbox{7}{\Var*{y}}
%	\end{bytefield}
%\end{center}
%This accepts the byte \Var*{y}, without interpreting it further. Thus, to send
%the hex byte \z{7E}, you send the two bytes \z{7F~7E}. To send a literal \z{7F}
%byte, send the two bytes \z{7F~7F}.
%
%The readerboard \acronym*{MAY} accept 8-bit values in the range 128--255 (hex
%\z{80}--\z{FF}) without using these escape codes, but this will confuse any other
%Lumos-compatible devices on the same serial network with them, so the best practice
%is to always use these escape codes for any value greater than or equal to 126 (hex
%\z{7E}). If using with other Lumos devices, you \acronym*{MUST} do so.
%
%\section{Lumos Compatibility}
%The readerboard may be connected to an RS-485 network that includes Lumos-protocol
%devices.\footnote{These include the Lumos power control boards and quiz show equipment
%created by the author.} 
%
%In this case, readerboard commands must begin with a start byte in the form
%\begin{center}
%	\begin{bytefield}[endianness=big]{8}
%		\bitheader{0-7} \\
%		\bitbox{1}{\z{1}}&
%		\bitbox{3}{\Var*{cmd}}&
%		\bitbox{4}{\Var*{ad$_0$}}
%	\end{bytefield}
%\end{center}
%and the address \Var*{ad$_0$} must be in the range 0--15. In this mode, all following
%bytes sent to the readerboard must have their \acronym{MSB} cleared (\z0).
%
%Only two \Var*{cmd} values are recognized by the readerboard.  For compatibility with
%other Lumos devices which recognize \Var*{cmd}=0 to mean turn off all output, the single-byte command
%\begin{center}
%	\begin{bytefield}[endianness=big]{8}
%		\bitheader{0-7} \\
%		\bitbox{1}{\z1}&
%		\bitbox[tbl]{1}{\z0}&
%		\bitbox[tb]{1}{\z0}&
%		\bitbox[tbr]{1}{\z0}&
%		\bitbox{4}{\Var*{ad$_0$}}
%	\end{bytefield}
%\end{center}
%will cause the readerboard addressed as \Var*{ad$_0$} to immediately turn off all
%\led s.
%
%For any other readerboard command, the start byte must be
%\begin{center}
%	\begin{bytefield}[endianness=big]{8}
%		\bitheader{0-7} \\
%		\bitbox{1}{\z{1}}&
%		\bitbox[tbl]{1}{\z1}&
%		\bitbox[tb]{1}{\z0}&
%		\bitbox[tbr]{1}{\z1}&
%		\bitbox{4}{\Var*{ad$_0$}}
%	\end{bytefield}
%\end{center}
%
%This may be followed by an address specifier (starting with a ``\z/'' character)
%documented above to include more sign addresses other than \Var*{ad$_0$}. If no such
%specifier is sent, then only sign \Var*{ad$_0$} will act on the command. If an empty
%specifier is sent, then \emph{all} signs will act on it.
%
%That is
%then followed by any of the readerboard commands documented below.\footnote{This
%is cheating just a little bit but is based on the assumption that no other Lumos
%device on any address will have \Var*{cmd} value 5 with the next byte being a
%``\z/'' character followed by zero or more encoded values 0--63 and an escape or
%dollar-sign.}
%
%\section{Command Termination and Error Handling}
%The command terminator is ``\z{\textasciicircum D}'' (hex byte value \z{04}). %We
%%\emph{recommend} that every command---or group of commands which together represent
%%a logical update to the sign---be followed by a \z{\textasciicircum D} character.
%This character \emph{must} follow each readerboard command, since the interpretation
%of the next command won't start until receipt of the 
%\z{\textasciicircum D},
%effectively
%ignoring any data sent after the end of the command and before the terminating
%\z{\textasciicircum D}.
%
%The exception to this rule is the set of Busylight-compatible commands
%\z*,
%\z?,
%\z{F},
%\z{S},
%and
%\z{X}.
%Since the Busylight unit did not use any command terminator in its protocol, the readerboard
%unit won't demand one either, although we \emph{recommend} that you do anyway. At the very least,
%you should have a
%\z{\textasciicircum D}
%character sent after a sequence of one or more Busylight-compatible commands.
%
%%The individual commands are executed immediately upon receipt, without requiring the
%%\z{\textasciicircum D} byte. For example, in the sequence ``\z{H1H2H3\textasciicircum D}''
%%the first bar graph data point will be displayed as soon as ``\z{H1}'' is received.
%
%In case of an error, such as the inability to parse the incoming command or an invalid
%field value, the readerboard will signal the error condition by lighting the white and
%both red discrete \led s, and will then ignore all input until the next
%\z{\textasciicircum D} byte is received.
%
%Whenever a \z{\textasciicircum D} byte is received, any command being parsed is aborted
%and the sign's input parser is reset. Thus, this byte may be sent in case a partial command
%has been sent but the host becomes aware that it cannot be completed. Note that the command
%may have been partially acted upon by that point, so no assumption should be made as to the
%sign's state.
%
%In the descriptions that follow, a trailing \z{\textasciicircum D} is shown at the end
%of each command to remind you of the recommendation to send this terminator, even though
%the commands themselves do not require them, strictly speaking.

\section{Command Summary}
The eight discrete \led s are intended for a simple display of status information
in a manner analogous to the Busylight project by the same author.\footnote{See
\href{https://github.com/MadScienceZone/busylight}{github.com/MadScienceZone/busylight}.}
To support this usage, the \z{F}, \z{S}, \z{X}, \z*, and \z? commands are recognized
in a manner compatible with how Busylight uses those same commands. These are categorized
as ``Busylight compatibility commands.'' Unlike all other commands listed here, these are
recognized regardless of case.  Since the readerboard has a power supply capable of illuminating
all of the status \led s at once,\footnote{The Busylight cannot, since it is powered
from the host computer's \acronym{USB} port.} a new command \z{L} is added which allows any
arbitrary pattern of steady \led s to be turned on.

The remaining commands are used for management of the matrix display. All commands are summarized in Table~\ref{tbl:commands}.

Although starting with the revision 2 hardware, the readerboard supports the ability to enable the RS-485 transmitter and send data back onto the network,
this is not currently implemented by the firmware, and the intent is to have all devices listen passively to RS-485 traffic
at all times. {\color{red} This is expected to change with the next revision of the firmware which allows responding over the RS-485 network.}

\section{\z{\%}---Run Full Lamp Test Pattern}

\end{Coding}
\end{center}

Displays various test patterns on the display to show that each element of each \acronym{LED} is working correctly
individually and in concert with others.

While running the test pattern set, the device is not responsive to other inputs or background operations.

\end{Coding}
\end{center}

Each \Var*{led} value is an \ascii\ character corresponding to a discrete
\led\ as shown in Table~\ref{tbl:lightcodes}. An \Var*{led} value of ``\z{\_}'' means
there is no \led\ illuminated at that point in the sequence.

This command functions identically to the \z{F} command (see below), except that the lights
are ``strobed'' (flashed very briefly with a pause between each light in the sequence).

\begin{Coding}
	|/readerboard/v1/scroll?a=|\Var*{ad}|&loop=|\Var*{bool}|&t=|\Var*{string}
\end{Coding}
\end{center}

Displays the text \Var*{string} by scrolling it across the display from right to left.
If \Var*{loop} is ``\z.'', the text is only scrolled once; if it is ``\z{L}'' then it
repeatedly scrolls across the screen in an endless loop.

The text is rendered in the current font and may contain any 8-bit bytes except as otherwise
noted (but avoiding \ascii\ control codes is wise to be safe from conflict with
future control codes which may be added to the protocol). The string is terminated by an
escape character (hex byte \z{1B}$_{16}$), indicated in the protocol description as \z{ESC}.

The string may include control codes as listed in Table~\ref{tbl:controlcodes}.
\begin{table}

\section{\z{=}---Set Operational Parameters}

\begin{bytefield}[endianness=little,bitwidth=0.11111\textwidth]{8}
%	\bitheader{0-3} \\

	\bitbox{1}{\Var*{uspd}}&
	\bitbox{1}{\Var*{rspd}}&
	\bitbox{1}{\Var*{ad$_G$}}
\end{bytefield}
\end{center}

This command sets a few operational parameters for the sign. Once set, these will be persistent across
power cycles and reboots.

If the \Var*{ad} parameter is ``\z{.}'' then the RS-485 interface is disabled entirely. Otherwise it is a
value from 0--63 encoded as described in Table~\ref{tbl:int063}. This enables the RS-485 interface and assigns
this sign's address to \Var*{ad}.

The baud rate for the \acronym{USB} and RS-485 interfaces is set by the \Var*{uspd} and \Var*{rspd} values
respectively. Each is encoded as per Table~\ref{tbl:baudcodes}.

The \Var*{ad$_G$} value is an address in the range 0--15 which is not assigned
to any other device on the RS-485 network. This is used to signal that all
readerboards should pay attention to the start of the command because it might
target them either as part of a list of specific readerboards or because the
command is intended for all readerboards at once. This is encoded in the 
same way as \Var*{ad}.
If you only have one readerboard or do not wish to assign a global address,
just set \Var*{ad$_G$} to the same value as \Var*{ad}.

This command may only be sent over the \acronym{USB} port.

By default, an unconfigured readerboard is set to 9,600 baud with the RS-485 port disabled, but these
defaults may be changed when compiling the firmware for specific devices.

%\\
%\begin{Coding}
%	|{"m":"query","a":[|\Var*{ad$_0$}|,|\dots|],"status":true}|
%\end{Coding}
\end{center}

This command causes the sign to send a status report back to the host to indicate
what the discrete \led s are currently showing. This response has the form:

\medskip

\begin{center}\begin{bytefield}[endianness=little,bitwidth=0.11111\textwidth]{9}
	\bitheader{0-8} \\
	\bitbox{1}{\z{L}} &
	\bitbox[tbl]{1}{\Var*{led$_0$}} &
	\bitbox[tb]{1}{\Var*{led$_1$}} &
	\bitbox[tb]{1}{\Var*{led$_2$}} &
	\bitbox[tb]{1}{\Var*{led$_3$}} &
	\bitbox[tb]{1}{\Var*{led$_4$}} &
	\bitbox[tb]{1}{\Var*{led$_5$}} &
	\bitbox[tb]{1}{\strut$\cdots$} &

	\bitbox{1}{\z{S}} &
	\bitbox{6}{strober status (see below)} &
	\bitbox{1}{\z{\$}} &
	\bitbox{1}{\z{\textbackslash n}}
\end{bytefield}
\end{center}

Each \Var*{led$_x$} value is a single character which is ``\z{\_}'' if the corresponding \led\ is
off, or the \led's color code or position number if it is on. One such value is sent for each \led\ installed
in the sign (typically eight for readerboards), followed by a ``\z{\$}'' to mark the end of the list.

The flasher and strober status values are variable-width fields which indicate the
state of the flasher (see \z{F} command) and strober (see \z{*} command) functions.
In each case, if there is no defined sequence, the status field will be:

\medskip

\begin{center}\begin{bytefield}[endianness=little,bitwidth=0.11111\textwidth]{2}
	\bitheader{0-1} \\
	\bitbox{1}{\Var*{run}} &
	\bitbox{1}{\strut\z{\_}}
\end{bytefield}
\end{center}

\smallskip

\noindent Otherwise, the state of the flasher or strober unit is indicated by:

\medskip

\begin{center}\begin{bytefield}[endianness=little,bitwidth=0.11111\textwidth]{7}
%	\bitheader{0-6} \\

In either case, \Var*{run} is the \ascii\ character ``\z{S}'' if the unit is
stopped or ``\z{R}'' if it is currently running.  If there is a defined sequence,
\Var*{pos} indicates the 0-origin position within the sequence of the light currently
being flashed or strobed, encoded as described in Table~\ref{tbl:int063}. 
The \Var*{led$_x$} values are as allowed for the \z{F} or \z{*}
command that set the sequence. (Regardless of the actual \z{F} or \z{*} command parameters,
the report will show symbolic color codes where possible, or numeric position codes otherwise.)

%Note that the \Var*{pos} value may be the character ``\z{X}'' to indicate the position
%value of 40, so it is important to distinguish between the field value
%``\Var*{run}\z{X}'' vs.\@ ``\Var*{run}\z{X@}\Var*{sequence}''.

The status message sent to the host is terminated by a newline character (hex byte \z{0A}),
indicated in the protocol description above as ``\z{\textbackslash n}''.

Each \Var*{led} value is an \ascii\ character corresponding to a discrete
\led\ as shown in Table~\ref{tbl:lightcodes}. Note that the assignment of colors
to these \led s is dependent on your particular hardware being assembled that way.
As an open source project, of course, you (or whomever assembled the unit) may choose any
color scheme you like when building the board.

An \Var*{led} value of ``\z{\_}'' means there is to be no \led\ illuminated at the
corresponding position in the sequence.

	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{cll}\toprule
			\multicolumn{1}{c}{\bfseries Code*}&

		\led s will match the custom color arrangement for that sign.\\(Custom firmware modification required.)}
		\caption{Discrete \led\ Codes and Colors\label{tbl:lightcodes}}
	\end{center}
\end{table}

Up to 64 \Var*{led} codes may be listed. The sign will cycle through the sequence, lighting each
specified \led\ briefly before moving on to the next one. The sequence is repeated
forever in a loop until an \z{L}, \z{S} or \z{X} command is received. 

If only one \Var*{led} is specified, that light will be flashed on and off.
Setting an empty
sequence (no codes at all) stops the flasher's operation.

The sequence is terminated by either a dollar-sign (``\z{\$}'') character or the
escape control character (hex byte \z{1B}$_{16}$), indicated in the protocol diagram above
simply as ``\z{\$}''.
			
This command may be given in upper- or lower-case (``\z{f}'' or ``\z{F}'').

\end{Coding}
\end{center}

This command is used to draw a bar-graph element. Repeating this command causes a
scrolling data display which shows a set of data samples over some period of time.

In the simplest form, it takes a single byte parameter.
The value \Var*{n} is an \ascii\ digit character in the range ``\z0''--``\z8'', and
is drawn in the far-right column of the matrix display, as a column of \Var*{n} lights
stacked up from the bottom row (a value of 0 results in no lights, up to 8 which is a full
column of eight lights; a value of 9 is treated as if it were 8). All existing matrix data
are scrolled left one column.

In the second form, it takes eight \Var*{rgb} values (see Table~\ref{tbl:rgbcolors}) which give the color to light up
each row in the bar-graph column.

%In \acronym{JSON}, the values of \Var*{n} and \Var*{rgb$_n$} are sent as integer values.
In \acronym{HTTP}, the value of \Var*{n} is sent as an integer value.

%(In \acronym{JSON}, since \Var*{col} is an integer value, this is represented
%by a value of $-1$ for \Var*{col}.)

Each column data, from left to right, are given by \Var*{coldata} values,
each of which is a two-digit \ascii\ hexadecimal value with the 
least-significant bit representing the top row of the matrix.
%(In \acronym{JSON}, these are simply plain decimal integer values.)

The column data values are terminated by either a dollar-sign (``\z{\$}'') character or the
escape control character (hex byte \z{1B}$_{16}$), indicated in the protocol diagram above
simply as ``\z{\$}''. 

The first set of column data provide the bits for the red color plane. After the terminating
byte, two more sets of column data are sent, each with identical format to the first, to provide
the bits for the green and blue color planes, respectively.

The column cursor is moved to be after the end of the image.

If \Var*{merge} is the character ``\z.'' then each column's contents is cleared before
setting the pixels as per the \Var*{coldata} value. If \Var*{merge} is ``\z{M}'' the bits
set in \Var*{coldata} are added to the lit pixels already in the column.

The \Var*{trans} value indicates the transition effect to use when adding the image
to the display. See Table~\ref{tbl:transitions}.

This command sets the color which all future commands will use by default (although
some of them allow for the specification of colors directly on an \emph{ad hoc} basis,
which does not affect the current default color).

The \Var*{rgb} value is a value encoded as defined in Table~\ref{tbl:rgbcolors}.
Note that anything drawn in black simply turns off the corresponding pixels.

This command is identical to the \z{S} command (see below), except that multiple
discrete \led s can be specified, all of which are illuminated simultaneously.
See Table~\ref{tbl:lightcodes}. Note that if a strobe sequence is running (via a previous \z{*} command), it remains running.

The list of \Var*{led} values is terminated by either a dollar sign (\z{\$}) character
or an escape byte (hex value \z{1B}), represented in the protocol diagram as ``\z{\$}''.

\end{bytefield}
\end{center}

The \Var*{model} field may be ``\z{L}'' for the legacy hardware the author still has
lying around (but this shouldn't be something anyone else would need to see),
``\z{M}'' for 64$\times$8 matrix display hardware with monochrome \acronym{LED}s, or
``\z{C}'' for 64$\times$8 \acronym{RGB} color display boards.

\Var*{hwversion} and \Var*{romversion} indicate the versions, respectively, of the 
hardware the firmware was compiled to drive, and of the firmware itself. Each of
these fields are variable-width and conform to the semantic version standard 2.0.0.\footnote{See
\href{https://semver.org}{semver.org}.} Each is terminated by a dollar-sign (\z\$) character (and
thus those strings may not contain dollar signs).

The \Var*{serial} field is a variable-width alphanumeric string which was set when the firm\-ware was
compiled. It should be a unique serial number for the device (although that depends on
some effort on the part of the person compiling the firmware to insert that serial number
each time). Serial numbers \z{RB000}--\z{RB299} are reserved for the original author's use. This string is also
terminated with a dollar sign.

The \Var*{EE} field is ``\z{X}'' if the device is fitted with an external \acronym{EEPROM} chip or module,
``\z{I}'' if using the \acronym{EEPROM} memory on the Arduino controller board, or ``\z{\_}'' if there
is no \acronym{EEPROM} memory at all (and thus, configuration settings made with the \z= commaand
are not persistent).

The \Var*{coldata} bytes are sent just as with the \z{I} command, as hexadecimal values indicating
the \led s lit on the matrix display, with \Var*{coldata$_0$} being the leftmost column of the display
and \Var*{coldata$_{63}$} being the rightmost. In each column, the least significant bit indicates
the \led\ on the top row.

The \Var*{ad}, \Var*{ad$_G$}, \Var*{uspd}, and \Var*{rspd} values are as last set by the \z= command (or the factory
defaults if they were never changed).

The status message sent to the host is terminated by a newline character (hex byte \z{0A}$_{16}$),
indicated in the protocol description above as ``\z{\textbackslash n}''.

\subsection{Busylight Device Query Response}
If a dedicated (non-readerboard) busylight device is sent the
\z{Q} command, it responds with the following information.

\end{Coding}
\end{center}

Stops the flasher (cancelling any previous \z{F} command) and turns off all discrete
\led s. The single \led\ indicated by \Var*{led} is turned on. See Table~\ref{tbl:lightcodes}. Note that if a strobe sequence is running (via a previous \z{*} command),
it remains running.

This command may be given in upper- or lower-case (``\z{s}'' or ``\z{S}'').

\end{center}

Displays the text \Var*{string} at the current cursor position. The cursor position is
then moved past the text to be ready for the next string to be printed.

The \Var*{align} code indicates how the text is aligned on the display (TBD).

The \Var*{trans} code specifies the transition effect to be used to add this string to the
display as shown in Table~\ref{tbl:transitions}.

The text is rendered in the current font and may contain any 8-bit bytes except as otherwise
noted (but avoiding \ascii\ control codes is wise to be safe from conflict with
future control codes which may be added to the protocol). The string is terminated by an
escape character (hex byte \z{1B}), indicated in the protocol description as \z{ESC}.
(Since a dollar sign may appear in \Var*{string}, the terminator must be an escape
character for this command.)

The string may include control codes as listed in Table~\ref{tbl:controlcodes}.

Turns off the flasher, strober, and all discrete \led s.

This command may be given in upper- or lower-case (``\z{x}'' or ``\z{X}'').

\chapter{Server-Only Commands}
\epigraph{The enjoyment of one’s tools is an essential ingredient of successful work.}{---Donald E. Knuth}
\LJversal{F}{or the most part} the server exists as a way to host readerboards and busylights from a central machine
while allowing users on other networked machines to post messages to them. It also provides a solution to the lack
of an ability for signs to coordinate content with each other. If you use the server's \acronym{API} to tell a
set of target signs to change their display contents, that will change whatever the sign was doing to what you
are now telling it to do, even if other users had put their own messages on it.

This chapter describes server-side coordination between users in a network environment by providing a set of
commands which clients can post to the server to request information to be displayed for them alongside other
content other users have posted. It also provides some services to keep boards updated with information
known to the server which the devices don't themselves track, such as time of day.

\section{\z{post}---Post a Message to the Displays}
\begin{center}
	\begin{Coding}
		|/readerboard/v1/post?a=|\Var*{ad}|&t=|\Var*{text}|&id=|\Var*{id}|&trans=|\Var*{trans}\\
		|&until=|\Var*{datetime}|&hold=|\Var*{duration}|&color=|\Var*{rgb}|&repeat=|\Var*{schedule}
	\end{Coding}
\end{center}

Adds a text message to the display list.  The message may include the special tokens listed in
Table~\ref{tbl:msgcodes}. The server will maintain the list of posted images
and will update the devices as needed to display dynamic content.

If any lower-level display matrix commands are received that directly manipulate
the matrix, the display of posted messages is suspended in favor of the directly
set content. When a \z{clear} command is received, then display of the posted
message list will resume.

The \Var*{id} value must be unique but the server doesn't assign these in order
to keep the \acronym{API} simple. Thus, it is recommended that you assign these as
\acronym{UUID}s or other scheme to keep them from colliding.

If \z{trans} is given, this message will be introduced using the specified
transition effect.

If \z{until} is given, the message will automatically unpost when the specified
date and time is reached.

If \z{hold} is given, the message will remain on-screen for the specified time
duration before moving on to the next posted message.

If \z{color} is given, the current color will be changed to the specified value
before writing the message; otherwise (or additionally) color codes may be
added in-line in the message text.

If \z{repeat} is given, \Var*{schedule} specifies (in a way yet to be determined)
a repeating display schedule for this message (e.g., display this every hour on the hour).

\chapter{Pinouts}
\epigraph{No cord or cable can draw so forcibly, or bind so fast, as love can do with a single thread.}{---Robert Burton}
\LJversal{T}{his chapter describes} each connector used by the readerboard devices and what signals are present
on which pins. Note that this begins with the current hardware revision, which is most likely the only part you need
to know about. Following that are the connector descriptions for older, legacy versions of the hardware. Be careful to
know which version you need to refer to.

\section{Connectors for Version 3.3 Boards}
\subsection{Arduino Bus Connectors [J0]}
Two parallel rows of stacking pins, for a total of 50 pins, extend out of the back of the readerboard \acronym{PCB}.
An Arduino Mega 2560 or Due microcontroller board is connected to these pins.

The \acronym{USB} connector on the Arduino board may be used to directly connect the readerboard to a \acronym{PC}
for initial configuration and/or to use it as a directly-connected singleton device. (If there are multiple
devices in use, it may be preferable to switch to the \acronym{RS-485} network after initial configuration of the
device.)

\subsection{Power / RS-485 (8-pin terminal) [J1]}
The single external connector on version 3.3.0 boards is an 8-pin screw terminal block. This accepts a +9\,V DC power input
and ground on pins 8 and 7 respectively, which powers the entire board and the attached Arduino controller.  If RS-485
communications will be used, the incoming signal is received on pins 1, 2, and 6 while the outgoing signal is on
pins 3, 4, and 5. (In actuality, the ``input'' and ``output'' sense is arbitrary and either set of A and B signals
may be used as input or output.) 

If this device is the last in the RS-485 network chain, insert a 120$\Omega$ resistor between the A and B terminals
that would have been used as the output if there had been another device connected there. This properly terminates
the RS-485 network at that point.

For readerboards before version 2.1.0, this 10-position ribbon cable carries signals to directly drive the 64$\times$8 \acronym{LED}
matrix.  The other end of the cable mates with J1 on the shield board. The pinout of its \acronym{IDC} header  is:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{rl|rl}

\subsubsection{Board Power (3-pin screw terminal) [J0]}
This 3-position screw terminal block provides power to the readerboard. Note that the +5\,V supply is also connected
to pins 13--16, and Ground to pins 17--20 of J1, the only power required here is the +9\,V input that drives the \acronym{LED}s themselves.

\subsubsection{Shield Power (5-pin screw terminal) [Shield J2]}
This 5-position screw terminal block accepts incoming +9\,V DC power and ground on pins 4 and 3 respectively. It then provides
+5\,V DC, +9\,V DC, and ground outputs on pins 1, 2, and 5 respectively to supply power to the main display board.

\subsubsection{Shield RS-485 (6-pin screw terminal) [Shield J4]}
This 6-position screw terminal block accepts incoming RS-485 signals A, B, and ground on pins 2, 1, and 3 respectively, and outputs
the network signals A, B, and ground on pins 6, 5, and 4 respectively, to go on to the next device in the chain. If this is the last
device, then nothing should be connected to pins 5 and 6. Instead, install jumper J5 which connects a 120$\Omega$ resistor across
those terminals to terminate the network at that point.

\chapter{Using the Readerboard}
\chapter{Font Glyphs}\label{chap:fonts}
\input{../firmware/readerboard/fonts.tex}
\section{Font Definition Files}
In the \z{firmware/readerboard} directory there are a set of files with \z{.font} suffixes,
which define the fonts that the readerboard can employ when writing text to the matrix.
If you edit these files, or add more fonts, make the appropriate adjustments to the
\z{Makefile} and run \z{make} in that directory to regenerate the glyph images on the
preceding pages of this document, and the source files where the glyphs are actually
stored in the device firmware. Then recompile the firmware image and flash it onto
the hardware devices.

Each file defines up to 256 glyphs with codepoint values 0--255. The firmware will not
allow some codepoints to be printed (see above, Tables~\ref{tbl:controlcodes}, \ref{tbl:font0}, and \ref{tbl:font2} on pp.~\pageref{tbl:controlcodes}--\pageref{tbl:font2}), so to avoid reserved codes we recommend using codepoints $\ge$ 32. 

Any line which begins (possibly after leading whitespace) with a semicolon (`\z;') is a comment and is ignored completely.

Each glyph definition begins with a line enclosed in square brackets, in the form
\begin{center}
	\begin{Coding}
		|[|\Var*{codepoint} \Var*{description}|]|
	\end{Coding}
\end{center}
Where \Var*{codepoint} is either the codepoint expressed as a decimal integer (e.g., ``\z{42}'') or
a dollar sign followed by the codepoint as a hex integer (e.g., ``\z{\$2B}''), and
\Var*{description} is an arbitrary text description of the character being defined.

For example:
\begin{SourceCode}
[$25 percent]
@@..@|
@@..@|
...@.|
..@..|
.@...|
@..@@|
@..@@|

[$2E period]
..||||
..||||
..||||
..||||
..||||
@@||||
@@||||
\end{SourceCode}

As a special case, a glyph introduced with the heading
\begin{center}
	\begin{Coding}
		|[default]|
	\end{Coding}
\end{center}
is defined to be the default glyph to be used if the user
tries to print a glyph that is not defined in the font. Only
one default glyph may be defined in the entire set of fonts.

The non-blank lines which follow the bracketed header line define
the bitmap for the glyph. In this definition, positions which are off
are noted with `\z{.}' or `\z{|}', while positions where the \acronym{LED} is
on are noted with `\z{@}'.

Any completely blank columns to the right of all lit pixels should be
represented by `\z{|}' rather than `\z{.}'. This will make note of the drawn
width of the character but the columns to the right which consist of `\z{|}'
characters are not actually stored in the firmware bitmap image, thus conserving
\acronym{ROM} space.

If fewer than eight rows are specified, it is assumed that the rows that are present
start at the top of the display, and the remaining unspecified rows are all off.

\subsection{Character Aliases}
If a character glyph is to be identical to another glyph, there is no point
in storing two or more identical bitmaps in the \acronym{ROM}. In such a case,
rather than presenting the duplicate bitmap, the character definition
is simply
\begin{center}
	\begin{Coding}
		|->|\Var*{codepoint}\\
		or\\
		|->|\Var*{codepoint}|,|\Var*{font index}
	\end{Coding}
\end{center}
In the first case, the glyph for the indicated codepoint will be reused for this character,
such as the case in Font~\#0 where the prime character (hex \z{\$87}) looks identical to
the single-quote character (hex \z{\$27}). Only the single-quote glyph is actually specified
in \z{standard.font}, so the prime character is defined only as
\begin{SourceCode}
[$87 prime]
->$27
\end{SourceCode}

In the second case, the glyph to be duplicated comes from a different font file entirely.
For example, many characters in Font~\#1 (\z{stand\-ard\-\_var\-i\-able.font}) have the same glyphs
as Font~\#0, such as:
\begin{SourceCode}
[$23 pound sign]
->$23,0
\end{SourceCode}

\chapter{Preparing and Updating Firmware Images}
The firmware that runs on the readerboard hardware (or, more precisely, the Arduino single-board
computer attached to the circuit board) is located in the \z{firmware/readerboard} directory of the
readerboard project repository.

After updating the code from the repository if necessary, perform the following steps to configure and
prepare the firmware image:

{\bfseries Step 1: Configuration.}\label{config-fw}
Edit the first few lines of \z{readerboard.h}:
\begin{SourceCode}
#define BANNER_HARDWARE_VERS "HW 3.2.3  "
#define BANNER_FIRMWARE_VERS "FW 0.0.0  "
#define BANNER_SERIAL_NUMBER "S/N XXXXXX"
#define SERIAL_VERSION_STAMP "V3.2.3$R0.0.0$SXXXXX$"
//                             \___/  \___/  \___/
//                               |      |      |
//                  Hardware version    |      |
//                         Firmware version    |
//                                 Serial number
\end{SourceCode}

The \z{BANNER\_FIRMWARE\_VERS} value should match the version of the firm\-ware source code you are compiling.

Set the \z{BANNER\_SERIAL\_NUMBER} value to the serial number for your specific device. Serial numbers under 300 are
reserved for the project author's use. If building your own device, assign a serial number that makes sense to you.
It will help you manage your collection of devices best if you give them unique serial numbers since those can be
queried by software.

Set the \z{SERIAL\_VERSION\_STAMP} value to match the previous three values while still preserving
the format ``\z{V}\dots\z{\$R}\dots\z{\$S}\dots\z{\$}''. This string will be sent verbatim as part
of the device's response to being queried for its configuration and status.

An example of a properly configured file looks like this:
\begin{SourceCode}
#define BANNER_HARDWARE_VERS "HW 3.2.3  "
#define BANNER_FIRMWARE_VERS "FW 1.2.0  "
#define BANNER_SERIAL_NUMBER "S/N R1024 "
#define SERIAL_VERSION_STAMP "V3.2.3$R1.2.0$SR1024$"
//                             \___/  \___/  \___/
//                               |      |      |
//                  Hardware version    |      |
//                         Firmware version    |
//                                 Serial number
\end{SourceCode}

{\bfseries Step 2: Set Hardware Model}.
A little further down \z{readerboard.h}, there is a pair of lines like:
\begin{SourceCode}
#define HW_MODEL (MODEL_3xx_RGB)
#define HW_MC (HW_MC_DUE)
\end{SourceCode}
		This should come already set up for the latest hardware model (in this example,
		the revision 3 \acronym{RGB} models which incorporate the Arduino directly onto
		the main circuit board). If your hardware uses a different design, such as one
		of the older legacy boards, \z{HW\_MODEL} needs to be changed to another hardware
		name, provided that name is actually supported (and supported correctly) in the rest
		of the firmware. 

		The supported values for these two configuration settings are listed in
		Table~\ref{tab:hwmodel}.
\begin{table}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{lp{3in}}\toprule
			\multicolumn{2}{c}{\bfseries Values for \z{HW\_MODEL} (Readerboard Hardware Model):}\\
			\z{MODEL\_3xx\_RGB}&\acronym{PCB} revision 3.0 and later with \acronym{RGB} \acronym{LED}s installed.\\
			\z{MODEL\_3xx\_MONOCHROME}&\acronym{PCB} revision 3.0 and later with single-color \acronym{LED}s installed with their
				anodes soldered into pin 4 (the blue circuit).\\\midrule
			\multicolumn{2}{c}{\bfseries Values for \z{HW\_MC} (Microcontroller Installed):}\\
			\z{HW\_MC\_MEGA\_2560}&Arduino Mega 2560.\\
			\z{HW\_MC\_DUE}&Arduino Due.\\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Firmware Configuration Values\label{tab:hwmodel}}
	\end{center}
\end{table}


{\bfseries Step 3: Make.}
		Run the \z{make} program. This will build the font tables from the various
		\z{*.font} files into the firmware code so the target device will be able to
		generate characters from those fonts.

		Customizing and extending the fonts is described in Chapter~\ref{chap:fonts}.

{\bfseries Step 4: Compile.}
		Using your Arduino compiler tools, compile the \z{readerboard.ino} file and upload it
		to your readerboard hardware. This step assumes you have set up your own Arduino
		development environment and is beyond the scope of this document to help you with.
