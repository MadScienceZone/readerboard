# Readerboard Hardware Files
The rev 2 board set includes:
 * The addition of a half-duplex RS-485 transceiver to the shield board.
 * A shrink of the matrix display board for more economical manufacturing and reduced finished product footprint.
 * Replacement of obsolete shift register chip with newer version.

## Schematic Capture Files
 * Prepared in kicad `matrix64x8/matrix64x8.kicad_sch` 
 * `matrix64x8_schematic.pdf` PDF file of schematic (display and shield boards).

## Ready-for-fab PCB Gerber Files
 * Prepared using gEDA PCB (because I only just started using kicad after I already made these):
   * `matrix64x8_102.zip` Main display board v1.0.1 (the prototype board I'm using for development)
   * `matrix64x8.pdf` Illustration of foil patterns, drilling, and component placement.
   * `matrix64x8shield.zip` Arduino shield board v1.0.0 (the prototype board I'm using for development)
   * `matrix64x8shield.pdf` Illustration of foil patterns, drilling, and component placement.
